# Components

## Board

- Full-sized decks are usually 7.5" and up. I have only ever ridden 8" decks, which is kind of in the middle, but anything in this range should work fine, as long as your feet aren't huge or tiny.

- Decks made by your local skate shop will probably be $5-$10 cheaper than a name brand deck.

## Trucks

- Make sure that your truck axle width matches your board width. You can find guides on the manufacturer sites for the various trucks, as well as on the sites for larger shops. The sizes are not standard across brand, so make sure to check size for the specific brand against your board width. It doesn’t need to match board width exactly, but needs to be in the same ballpark. 

- Trucks often come in different heights. I would recommend a higher truck, which will make [wheel bite](https://www.thelongboardstore.com/blog/crunch-time-how-to-prevent-wheel-bite-/) less likely.

- Many brands offer light, hollow, or titanium version of their trucks. All of these will be lighter than a standard truck, but will cost more (~\$10-20 more per truck, and you will need two). The advantage for a beginner will be that your board will be lighter to carry, and will be easier to push when skating up hill. If you are mostly skating downhill or flat, or don't mind the extra workout, than standard trucks will be fine.

- Any brand of truck should work fine for you. Thunder and Independent are the most popular, with Independent thought of as more sturdy but less agile, and Thunder being the opposite; but either brand should be sufficiently sturdy/durable and agile for a beginner.

## Wheels

- The two things that matter most here in my experience are size and hardness. [Here is a good guide](https://www.warehouseskateboards.com/help/Skateboard-Wheels-Buying-Guide) that explains the ins and outs of both those qualities.

- If you mostly want to cruise around, I would recommend a softer wheel because they ride smoother and faster, are better for rough terrain (you won't go flying if you hit a crack or an acorn), and they are quieter. I like 78A for hardness, which is about as soft as you can get, but something in the 80s or 90s should be fine too. I wouldn’t go too hard, unless you mainly plan to skate in well-paved parks. For size, I would recommend between 52-54mm. I personally love [these](https://www.tactics.com/ricta/cloud-skateboard-wheels/white-blue-chrome-78a) in 78a at 54mm.

## Bearings

- I am not opinionated about these. Any bearing you find at a skate shop should be fine.

## Hardware

- This is what attaches your trucks to your board, and you might assume that it comes with the trucks; it does not. The only thing that will really matter here is length. Most hardware is 7/8", and that will be fine, as long as you are not using riser pads (which will not be covered here because I have never used them). You can get extra-light hardware, but standard hardware is already sufficiently light. You might have a choice between e.g., allen and phillips head. I like [Shorty's Silverado's](https://www.shortysinc.com/products/shortys-silverados-phillips-head-hardware?variant=33606284640387) because they have two silver bolts which can be placed at the nose or tail end of the board as a cue to board orientation...and also I just like Shorty's.

## Griptape

- Any kind will do. If you want, you can pay a little more for a specific color or graphic. I personally like grip with custom cutouts that can be used as a cue for board orientation, but you can make that kind of cutout yourself if you are brave. This is probably the easiest part of the board to buy, but the hardest part to install. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2llhl4Mft4) is a great guide. Watch it twice before installing, and then watch during installation.
